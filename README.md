# Fixed Point Photography Plugin for Wordpress

This is a Wordpress plugin built for the Spring Creek Forest Preservation Society as part of my Eagle Project. While it is for the SCFPS, any nature preservation society with a wordpress website may use this plugin to power any fixed point photography stations throughout their preserves.

## Use

The plugin works by providing shortcodes that you may place on a webpage that users may upload photos from. Ideally, there will be QR codes at every station pointing to its unique upload page so that the images do not get mixed from multiple photo spots.

<br>
Uploaded images will be sent to the server and await moderation/approval by an admin before becoming publicly viewable or becoming a part of the timelapse.

# vscode-devcontainer-wordpress

This contains the configuration necessary for setting up WordPress development using VSCode Dev Containers.
A MariaDB and WordPress devlopment container are started, and Wordpress is automatically installed and available at http://localhost:8080.

## Configuration

By default the container is configured for plugin development, but you can switch to theme development by changing the volume for the WordPress service in `docker-compose.yml`

WordPress settings can be configured in `.devcontainer/wp-setup.sh`, i.e. the site name, and admin user account details. You can also specify a space-separated list of WordPress plugins to automatically install as well. By setting `WP_RESET` to `true`, the container will rebuild the WordPress instalation from scratch every time it is loaded. 

## Data folder

Any `.sql` files placed `.devcontainer/data` will be automatically imported when your site is built (using `wp db import`). It is up to you to ensure table name prefixes will match (defualt is wp_).

Anything placed in the `plugins` folder (single files or folders) will be copied into the WordPress plugins folder and activated as a plugin. This enables things like defining custom post types relevant to your imported data set, but not part of the development process.

## Included Tools

- XDebug, configured 
- WP-CLI
- Composer
- NodeJS
- PHP/WordPress extensions for VSCode (see `devconatainer.json`)

## TODO

- provide a preconfigured launch.json for PHP debugging
- theme auto-install
